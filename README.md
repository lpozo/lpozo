### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Leodanis Pozo Ramos

I'm a self-taught Python developer, technical writer, and Open Source contributor. I'm interested in GUI application development using PyQt and PySide2. My great passion is to write Python articles & tutorials to help other people to learn how to program using Python.
