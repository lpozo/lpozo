### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Leodanis here!

I'm a self-taught Python developer, technical writer, content creator, and Open Source contributor. My great passion is to write articles and tutorials to help other people learn how to program in Python. You can find some of my writing here: [Leodanis' Real Python Profile](https://realpython.com/team/lpozoramos/).
